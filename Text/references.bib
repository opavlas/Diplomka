It consists of two segmented silicon detectors (256 × 256 pixels, pixel pitch 55 μm, thicknesses 300 μm and 500 μm) facing each other. To enhance the neutron detection efficiency a set of converter layers is inserted in between these detectors. The pixelation and the two-layer design allow a discrimination of neutrons against γs by pattern recognition and against charged particles by using the coincidence and anticoincidence information. The neutron conversion and detection efficiencies are measured in a thermal neutron field and fast neutron fields with energies up to 600 MeV. A Geant4 simulation model is presented, which is validated against the measured detector responses. The reliability of the coincidence and anticoincidence technique is demonstrated and possible applications of the detector setup are briefly outlined.}

	abstract = {This paper introduces a readout system for the Timepix2. Firstly, this chip is described and the readout modes are   discussed in detail. The new readout system presented is based on   the Gigabit Ethernet interface and implements pre-processing, i.e.   decoding of the raw pixel data, directly in the hardware. The device   suppresses zero pixels, so that only useful data are sent to the   computer/server. In a special independent mode, the readout can send   completed data files to a remote server via SSH and does not need to   use a control software. In island mode, the device stores measured   data to a local storage (SD card). The process of calibration and   its results are also discussed. An energy resolution of   approximately 1.5 keV was achieved for 60 keV gamma-rays from an   241Am source. We present enhanced features of the readout   system facilitating measurements and data evaluation, such as the   HW support of clustering and Matrix Occupation Control. The former implements the pixel clustering directly in   the hardware and sends energy calibrated results of the cluster   finding algorithm to the computer. The latter automatically controls   acquisition time of detector in order to reduce cluster   overlapping. Measurements with Timepix2 are presented in iron and   electron test beams. Results show that pixels of Timepix2 saturate   at a per-pixel energy deposition of 1.9 MeV.}

	title = {Timepix3: a 65K channel hybrid pixel readout chip with simultaneous ToA/ToT and sparse readout},
	journal = {Journal of Instrumentation},
	abstract = {The Timepix3, hybrid pixel detector (HPD) readout chip, a successor to the Timepix \cite{timepix2007} chip, can record time-of-arrival (ToA) and time-over-threshold (ToT) simultaneously in each pixel. ToA information is recorded in a 14-bit register at 40 MHz and can be refined by a further 4 bits with a nominal resolution of 1.5625 ns (640 MHz). ToT is recorded in a 10-bit overflow controlled counter at 40 MHz. Pixels can be programmed to record 14 bits of integral ToT and 10 bits of event counting, both at 40 MHz. The chip is designed in 130 nm CMOS and contains 256  × 256 pixel channels (55  ×  55 μm2). The chip, which has more than 170 M transistors, has been conceived as a general-purpose readout chip for HPDs used in a wide range of applications. Common requirements of these applications are operation without a trigger signal, and sparse readout where only pixels containing event information are read out.
	
	A new architecture has been designed for sparse readout and can achieve a throughput of up to 40 Mhits/s/cm2. The flexible architecture offers readout schemes ranging from serial (one link) readout (40 Mbps) to faster parallel (up to 8 links) readout of 5.12 Gbps. In the ToA/ToT operation mode, readout is simultaneous with data acquisition thus keeping pixels sensitive at all times. The pixel matrix is formed by super pixel (SP) structures of 2  ×  4 pixels. This optimizes resources by sharing the pixel readout logic which transports data from SPs to End-of-Column (EoC) using a 2-phase handshake protocol.
	
	To reduce power consumption in applications with a low duty cycle, an on-chip power pulsing scheme has been implemented. The logic switches bias currents of the analog front-ends in a sequential manner, and all front-ends can be switched in 800 ns. The digital design uses a mixture of commercial and custom standard cell libraries and was verified using Open Verification Methodology (OVM) and commercial timing analysis tools. The analog front-end and a voltage-controlled oscillator for 1.5625 ns timing resolution have been designed using full custom techniques.}

	abstract = {The Timepix2 ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) is the upgraded successor to the Timepix [1] hybrid pixel detector readout chip. Like the original, Timepix2 contains a matrix of 65k square pixels of 55 μm pitch that can be coupled to a similarly segmented semiconductor sensor, or integrated in an ionising gas detector. The pixels are programmable, with several operation modes and selectable counter depths (up to 18 bits for time-of-arrival, ToA, and up to 14 bits for time-over-threshold, ToT). In ToT and ToA mode, each pixel records the arrival time and energy deposited by particles interacting with the corresponding sensor segment, with an optional separation of timing resolution for ToT and ToA: down to 10 ns each. The gain of the frontend circuit can be programmed to adapt to the quantity of energy deposited in the sensor, yielding a large dynamic range of 0.38 ke− to 950 ke−. The frontend noise in adaptive gain mode is 380 e− rms. The design also introduces some power optimisation features to the Timepix portfolio, such as power masking on selectable parts of the pixel matrix. With all pixels powered on, using 100 MHz for both ToT and ToA clock frequencies, and assuming a sparse particle interaction with the pixels, the matrix is estimated to consume less than 900 mW based on simulation.}

Like its predecessor, Timepix3, it can operate in data driven mode sending out information (Time of Arrival, ToA and Time over Threshold, ToT) only when a pixel has a hit above a pre-defined and programmable threshold. In this mode hits can be tagged to a time bin of &lt;200 ps and Timepix4 can record hits correctly at incoming rates of ∼3.6 MHz/mm2/s. In photon counting (or frame-based) mode it can count incoming hits at rates of up to 5 GHz/mm2/s. In both modes data is output via between 2 and 16 serializers each running at a programmable data bandwidth of between 40 Mbps and 10 Gbps. The specifications, architecture and circuit implementation are described along with first electrical measurements and measurements with radioactive sources. In photon counting mode X-ray images have been taken at a threshold of 650 e− (with &lt;10 masked pixels). In data driven mode images were taken of ToA/ToT data using a 90Sr source at a threshold of 800 e− (with ∼120 masked pixels).}

	abstract = {The semiconductor pixel detector Timepix (256×256 pixels with pitch of 55μm) is a successor of the Medipix2 device. Each Timepix pixel can be independently operated in one of three possible modes: (1) counting of the detected particles; (2) measurement of the particle energy; and (3) measurement of the time of interaction. The energy measurement in the second mode is performed via the determination of the “time-over-threshold” (TOT). The energy measurement with the Timepix detector in TOT mode requires knowledge of the energy calibration of each pixel of the matrix. Such calibration is very nonlinear in the low energy range and can be described by a surrogate function depending on four parameters. The determination of all these parameters can be performed by measurement and evaluation of the response of each pixel in at least four calibration points. The procedure is extremely demanding: it requires the analysis of at least 250 thousand spectra and the performance of 330 thousand least-squares fits. In this article, it is demonstrated that even better result can be achieved with only two or three calibration points halving the number of least-squares fits needed. The method is based on precise analysis of the shape of spectral peaks. The article also discusses the performance of energy calibrated device for spectrometry of heavy charged particles.}

	abstract = {We investigate the response of the new Timepix2 chip to heavy ions. Understanding this response is important to understand the performance and capabilities of this chip in the space environment, where it is a possible replacement for the existing Timepix chip which is already widely used in space. We carry out measurements on Timepix2 using a variety of heavy ion beams. We find that the Timepix2 generally performs as expected for a variety of measurements. We confirm that the Timepix2 front end can measure up to at least 2.2MeV in silicon per pixel. We also confirm that improvements in the pixel interaction with the shutter allow for measurements of individual tracks in fields substantially more intense than those measurable by Timepix. We conclude that the Timepix2 is a very promising candidate for use in space radiation measurements.}
